Why did you take this course and what are you hoping to get out of it?
I was hoping to further develop my coding skills, I had already learned Python before, but it was mainly for contests rather than actually making games with modules such as pygame. I believe that this course could help me put the skills that I developed through my coding contests into real-world use. 
What games and/or applications do you think are designed very well or have interesting features you would like to learn how to implement in your own games/applications? List the apps and features.
I think that learning how to code your own website would be cool, as well as maybe learning some SQL. I want to be able to use Python to perhaps make a server or link devices together, as well as automate certain parts of my life.
